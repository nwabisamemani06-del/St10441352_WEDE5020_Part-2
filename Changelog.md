index.html changes:
Added the commends on html on all of the pags. Added css stylesheet on every page, removed sections and put main and classes to 
classify elements that have similar styling needs and when  work on the css  can easily divide and work on the HTML need to work on like for an example i have <div class=welcome paragraphs>. 
Also addes div to hold a header part, a primary content section, or a footer.
on the footer section  added the links to instagram, facebook and tiktok to show as icons of the social media we on, on every page on the website for users when they need to 
go in our social media pages and not go to the home page to access it. Added one more picture on this page.

About Us.html
Added cooments, put in <div> and <h2> groups and also in a clean <main> container with proper paragraphs for the text.  Repetitive heads inside divs and superfluous line breaks were eliminated.
By fixing class names to avoid spaces (for instance, class="about-us" rather than "About Us"), CSS style becomes more depandaple so can use.  Instead of being all over the place among several divisions with headings, they are now clearly divided into paragraphs.
Using <strong> tags, key phrases like "Mission" and "Vision" are emphasized without disrupting the paragraph's flow.
A few words to make them more readable and clear, eliminating redundancy while preserving the main points of the sneaker mode history, mission, and objectives.
Applying contemporary CSS styles like spacing, font hierarchy, color accents, and responsive design is now simple because the HTML is clear and semantic.

Services Page.html
Rearranged the material to provide a layout that is contemporary, well-structured, and easy to use.  The individual sneakers are no longer displayed using
<h2> and <img> combinations, but rather as product cards inside a grid container. The price, sneaker name, and image on each product card make the information visually appealing and easy to read.
Emphasized the pricing by designating a certain price class.  Positioned the product cards inside a responsive grid container, which improves mobile usability by automatically adjusting to various screen sizes.
Also included a shipping form underneath the grid of products.  Radio buttons for Standard, Express, and Overnight shipping options are included in this form; it is properly structured inside a <form> element and has legible labels.  This preserves accessibility  while enabling users to choose a delivery option with ease.

Enquiry.html
The page now clearly separates several sections, including the Sizing Guide, Return Policy, Enquiry Form, and Shipping Options, by using <section> elements rather than
incorrectly nested <main> tags.  An illustration of the sneaker size chart with the various sizes for men and women, wrapped in a container for improved design, is included in the sizing guide section.  The return policy, which explains the quality of the sneakers  offer and our desire to help consumers if they're not happy, is laid out in clear phrases.

Contact.html
In order to avoid layout issues, corrected stray tags and fixed class names that contained spaces, such contact-info.  
The page was visually enhanced by adding a contact image with a faint shadow and a rounded border. 
Users can now easily contact the company by phone or email by clicking on the links to the email and phone number.

Map.html
Added a file called a map and added a link of google maps and a paragraph that entails users where to find our shop and gives them directions on how to get there in case they are not from here.
